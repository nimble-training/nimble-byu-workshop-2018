# Exercises

 - Run an MCMC on your own model
 - Try modifying the scale or propCov arguments to the cross-level sampler (see how we did this for the standard block sampler) and see if that eliminates the initial stickiness of the sampler.
 - Play with different initializations for the block samplers
 - Run one or more of the MCMC variants with multiple chains and judge convergence based on the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic or other diagnostics you like.
 - Take one of the example models from [here](example_models_slides.html) and run a basic MCMC and try modifying the MCMC configuration.
