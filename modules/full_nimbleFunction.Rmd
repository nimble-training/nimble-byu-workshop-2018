# Components of a nimbleFunction

NIMBLE uses the concept of *two-stage evaluation* from computer science to run a model-specific algorithm based on model-generic algorithm code. The first stage of evaluation specializes the algorithm to the model of interest via *setup* code. The second stage runs the algorithm via *run* code. 

Thus, a nimbleFunction has two parts:

 - setup code: used to tailor the algorithm to a particular model structure. Often this involves determining dependencies amongst nodes in the model and setting up storage using *modelValues*
 - run code: the guts of the algorithm, written generically so it will apply to any (appropriate) model

Setup code is written as a R function, using R code, usually including NIMBLE's special functions for querying the model structure (see the module *model_structure*). 

Run code is written using the NIMBLE *domain-specific language* (DSL). While this is formally a language distinct from R, you can just think of it as a subset of R, enhanced with some functions for operating on the model (see the module *operating_model*). 


# Using `modelValues` objects to store sets of node values for a model

A common need is to store multiple sets of values for model variables, such as MCMC output, sets of particles for a particle filter, or an input sample for importance sampling.

NIMBLE provides a `modelValues` class for this purpose.  A `modelValues` class can be created to hold the variables in a model or any other sets of variables you define.

Like models and algorithms, modelValues objects have uncompiled and compiled versions that can be used in (mostly) the same ways.

# Putting the pieces together

Let's walk through an example where we use all the functionality we've discussed above:

 - querying model structure in setup code
 - using model calculations in run code
 - using modelValues storage

We'll do this by writing a generic marginalized sampling nimbleFunction.

Why is this useful?

By marginalizing, we reduce dimensionality so we (generally) reduce the number of computations and (generally) reduce posterior dependence. But we often are interested in inference for the marginalized quantities.

# Example: nimbleFunction for sampling marginalized parameters

We need the samples from the marginalized model, plus a model object for the unmarginalized model.

Let's construct our (generic) nimbleFunction:

```{r nf-marginal}
margSampler <- nimbleFunction(
            setup = function(full_model, samples, target) {
                  ## setup MCMC only for integrated-over nodes
                  conf <- configureMCMC(full_model, nodes = target)
                  
                  ## check everything is conjugate
                  samplers <- sapply(conf$getSamplers(),
                     function(x) x$name)
                  if(length(samplers) != length(grep("conjugate", samplers)))
                     stop("Not all samplers are conjugate")

                  ## check samples have the all nodes in marginalized model
                      allNodes <- full_model$getNodeNames(stochOnly = TRUE, includeData = FALSE)
                      targetNodes <- full_model$expandNodeNames(target)
                      margNodes <- allNodes[!allNodes %in% targetNodes]
                      neededVars <- full_model$getVarNames(nodes = margNodes)
                      margModelVars <- full_model$getVarNames(nodes = dimnames(samples)[[2]])
                      if(any(!neededVars %in% margModelVars))
                         stop("Some needed variables not present in modelValues for marginalized model")
                  
                  ## create MCMC object and modelValues for full model
                  mcmc <- buildMCMC(conf)
                  new_mv = modelValues(full_model, m = 1)
            }, run = function(samples = double(2)) {
                  ## dynamically determine how many samples we will get ('samples' might have been updated since setup code was run)
                  nIts <- dim(samples)[1]
                  resize(new_mv, nIts)

                  ## sample integrated-over nodes once per thinned iteration of original MCMC
                  for(i in 1:nIts) {
                      values(full_model, margModelVars) <<- samples[i, ]
                      mcmc$run(1, reset = FALSE, progressBar = FALSE)
                      copy(full_model, new_mv, row = i)
                  }
            })
```
                  

# Example: litters model
                

```{r}
littersMargModel <- nimbleModel(littersMargCode, 
          data = littersData, constants = littersConsts, inits = littersInits)
cLittersMargModel <- compileNimble(littersMargModel)
thin = 10
littersMargConf <- configureMCMC(littersMargModel, print = TRUE, thin = thin)
littersMargMCMC <- buildMCMC(littersMargConf)
cLittersMargMCMC <- compileNimble(littersMargMCMC, project = littersMargModel)
niter <- 5000
nburnin <- 1000
samples <- runMCMC(cLittersMargMCMC, niter, nburnin)

littersModel <- nimbleModel(littersCode, 
          data = littersData, constants = littersConsts, inits = littersInits)
cLittersModel <- compileNimble(littersModel)

rMargSampler <- margSampler(littersModel, samples, 'p')
cMargSampler <- compileNimble(rMargSampler, project = littersModel, showCompilerOutput=T)
cMargSampler$run()
fullSamples <- as.matrix(cMargSampler$new_mv)
```

# Comments

- In general, you should pass uncompiled models and modelValues into nimbleFunction setup code. 
- In general, you can assume that anything in a nimbleFunction will get compiled, so you don't need to worry about whether the modelValues or any nimbleFunctions you use within a nimbleFunction are compiled or uncompiled.
