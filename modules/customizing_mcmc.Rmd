# The litters model

Here's the graph of the litters model.

Here we set up the litters model.

```{r, litters-code}
```
```{r, litters-model}
```
```{r, litters-compile}
```

# NIMBLE's default MCMC

Here are the results from running NIMBLE's default MCMC:

```{r, prep, echo=FALSE}
# so attendees can run code below this without using code from other modules
if(FALSE) 
  if(!exists('littersModel') || !exists('cLittersModel')) source('chunks.R')
```                   

```{r, litters-default, fig.height=6, fig.width=12, fig.cap=''}
littersConf <- configureMCMC(littersModel, monitors = c('a', 'b', 'p'))
littersMCMC <- buildMCMC(littersConf)
cLittersMCMC <- compileNimble(littersMCMC, project = littersModel)
niter <- 5000
nburn <- 1000
set.seed(1)
samples <- runMCMC(cLittersMCMC, niter = niter, nburnin = nburn,
        inits = littersInits, nchains = 1, samplesAsCodaMCMC = TRUE)

makePlot(samples)
```

# Customizing samplers: examining the defaults

One of NIMBLE's most important features is that users can easily modify the MCMC algorithm used for their model. The easiest thing to do is to start with NIMBLE's default MCMC and then make modifications. 

```{r default-config}
littersConf$printSamplers()
```

# Customizing samplers: modifying the samplers

```{r customize-mcmc}
hypers <- c('a[1]', 'b[1]', 'a[2]', 'b[2]')
for(h in hypers) {
      littersConf$removeSamplers(h)
      littersConf$addSampler(target = h, type = 'slice')
}
littersConf$printSamplers()

littersMCMC <- buildMCMC(littersConf)
## we need 'resetFunctions' because we are rebuilding the MCMC for an existing model for
## which we've already done some compilation
cLittersMCMC <- compileNimble(littersMCMC, project = littersModel, resetFunctions = TRUE)

set.seed(1)
samplesSlice <- runMCMC(cLittersMCMC, niter = niter, nburnin = nburn,
             inits = littersInits, nchains = 1, samplesAsCodaMCMC = TRUE)
```

# Customizing samplers: Initial results

We can look at diagnostics and see if the change in samplers had an effect. Interestingly, despite the posterior correlation between ```a[i]``` and ```b[i]```, a simple change just to the univariate samplers for the four hyperparameters has had some effect on MCMC performance.

Caveat: the real question is the effective sample size per unit of computation time (each slice sampler iteration is slower than each Metropolis iteration), but we don't assess that at the moment.

```{r output-slice, fig.height=6, fig.width=12, fig.cap=''}
library(coda, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
effectiveSize(samplesSlice)
makePlot(samplesSlice)
```
