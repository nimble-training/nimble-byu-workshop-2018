 - Run MCMCs for both representations for the Faithful data
 - In general, the number of components will be much less than $n$. Try allowing only $m << n$ components in the dCRP representation and see if seems to work as well. This should give a major speedup in computational time.
 - If you have a model in which a non-parametric density might be of interest, try to start coding up the BUGS code for it.
